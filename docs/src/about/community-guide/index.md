# Community Guide

What the community can do for you and what you can do for the community.

## Resources

### Code of Conduct

Our [Code of Conduct](/about/community-guide/code-of-conduct) is a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

## What you can do

### Help Fellow Usersâ€‹

Code contribution is not the only form of contribution to the Pointhub community. Answering a question for a fellow Pointhub user on Discord or the forum is also considered a valuable contribution.

### Contribute Code

Contributing bug fixes or new features is the most direct form of contribution you can make.

The Pointhub core repository provides a [contributing guide](/guide/contribution-guide/commit-message-convention), which contains pull request guidelines and information regarding build setup and high-level architecture. Please make sure to read them before submitting pull requests.
