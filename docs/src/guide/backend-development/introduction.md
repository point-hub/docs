# Backend Development

Design principles in programming help developers create clean, modular, and maintainable code. By adhering to principles such as KISS, DRY, SOLID, and separation of concerns, you ensure that your code is easier to debug, extend, and understand. These principles are fundamental not only for individual developers but also for teams working on large-scale projects where maintainability and collaboration are key.
