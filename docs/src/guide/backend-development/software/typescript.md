TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static types and other features that improve the development process. Here are the key reasons why we choose to use TypeScript:

##  Static Typing

- **Early Error Detection:** TypeScriptâ€™s static type system allows you to catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime. This can help identify potential issues early in the development process, which reduces bugs and improves code reliability. For example, you might catch issues like trying to call a method on an undefined or null value before the code is even executed.

- **Type Safety:** TypeScript enforces type constraints that prevent you from passing incorrect data types into functions, methods, or variables. This type safety helps prevent common runtime errors that can be difficult to debug in large JavaScript applications.

```typescript
// TypeScript catches this error before runtime
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

add(2, "3");  // Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'
```

## Enhanced IDE Support and Autocompletion

- **Better Autocompletion:** TypeScript's type information helps IDEs (such as VS Code) provide better autocompletion, tooltips, and inline documentation. This makes it easier to write code quickly and accurately, even if you're not familiar with the API or library you're using.
