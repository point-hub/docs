# MongoDB Database for Development

Since transactions are built on concepts of logical sessions they require mechanics which are only available in a replica set environment.

Choose one of the options that you prefer

- Install offline MongoDB database replica set using docker
[Docker MongoDB RS](https://github.com/point-hub/docker-mongodb-rs)

- Use online Database as a Service (DBaaS) [Atlas MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)
