# Essentials

Becoming a great programmer takes a combination of technical skills, mindset, and continuous learning. Here are some essential things you should focus on to grow as a great programmer

## 1. Design Principles
    
Using design principles in software development is essential for building maintainable and scalable systems. These principles provide a foundation for solving complex problems and ensure that the codebase remains clean and adaptable as the application evolves over time.

- [Clean Architecture](/guide/essentials/design-principles/clean-architecture)
- [Solid Principles](/guide/essentials/design-principles/solid-principles)
- [KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)](/guide/essentials/design-principles/kiss)
- [DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)](/guide/essentials/design-principles/dry)
- [Separation of Concern](/guide/essentials/design-principles/separation-of-concern)
- [Encapsulation](/guide/essentials/design-principles/encapsulation)

## 2. Design Patterns
    
Design patterns are time-tested, generalized solutions to recurring problems that arise in software development. When you use design patterns, you are leveraging these proven solutions, which reduces the likelihood of reinventing the wheel.

### Creational Patterns

- [Builder Pattern](/guide/essentials/design-patterns/builder-pattern)
- [Factory Pattern](/guide/essentials/design-patterns/factory-pattern)
- [Provider Pattern](/guide/essentials/design-patterns/builder-pattern)
- [Singleton Pattern](/guide/essentials/design-patterns/singleton-pattern)

### Structural Patterns

- [Adapter Pattern](/guide/essentials/design-patterns/adapter-pattern)
- [Facade Pattern](/guide/essentials/design-patterns/facade-pattern)
- [Repository Pattern](/guide/essentials/design-patterns/repository-pattern)

### Behavioral Patterns

- [Strategy Pattern](/guide/essentials/design-patterns/strategy-pattern)

## 3. Testing
    
Writing tests forces you to structure your code in a way that is modular, testable, and loosely coupled. Testable code is usually well-designed code, as it often requires clear interfaces and separation of concerns. This encourages developers to write clean, maintainable code.

- [Test Driven Development](/guide/essentials/testing/test-driven-development)
- [Behavior Driven Development](/guide/essentials/testing/behavior-driven-development)
- [End-to-End Testing](/guide/essentials/testing/end-to-end-testing)
- [Performance Testing](/guide/essentials/testing/performance-testing)
- [Continous Testing](/guide/essentials/testing/continous-testing)

## 4. Best Practice
    
Adhering to best practices in software development is essential for building high-quality, maintainable, and scalable software. Best practices are the proven methods, strategies, and techniques that have been refined over time by the software development community.

- [Code Style](/guide/essentials/best-practices/code-style)
- [Naming Convention](/guide/essentials/best-practices/naming-convention)
- [Deep Nesting](/guide/essentials/best-practices/deep-nesting)
