# KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

This principle emphasizes simplicity in code. Avoid unnecessary complexity and strive for solutions that are as simple as possible but still meet the requirements.

**Purpose:** Simple code is easier to read, understand, and maintain. Complexity should be introduced only when absolutely necessary.

**Application:**
- Write code that is easy to follow.
- Avoid convoluted solutions when a simpler one will suffice.
