# Encapsulation

Encapsulation refers to bundling data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class, and restricting access to some of the object's components.

**Purpose:** It helps protect the integrity of the data and prevents unintended interference or misuse.

**Application:**
- Use private or protected access modifiers to restrict access to sensitive data, allowing it to be changed only through controlled methods (getters/setters).
- Hide implementation details and expose only necessary functionality to the user of the class.
