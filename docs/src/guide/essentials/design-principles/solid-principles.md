# SOLID Principles

SOLID is an acronym for a set of five design principles aimed at making object-oriented software more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:

## S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): 

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility.

**Application:** 
- Each class should be focused on a single task or feature, making it easier to maintain and extend.

## O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP): 

Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Application:** 
- Instead of modifying existing code, add new functionality by extending existing components.

## L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): 

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

**Application:** 
- Ensure that subclasses behave in a way that doesnâ€™t break the expectations set by their parent classes.

## I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): 

Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

**Application:** 
- Keep interfaces small and focused on specific tasks, so that classes are not burdened with unused methods.

## D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): 

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

**Application:** 
- Avoid tightly coupling high-level business logic with low-level details like database operations or networking. Use abstractions to decouple these concerns.
