# DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)

This principle encourages avoiding the duplication of code. When a piece of logic or functionality is repeated, it should be abstracted into a reusable function or module.

**Purpose:** Repeated code makes maintenance more difficult and increases the risk of bugs. By abstracting logic, you make the codebase more modular and maintainable.

**Application:**
- Identify repeated code and refactor it into functions, methods, or classes.
- Reuse code components to avoid unnecessary repetition.
