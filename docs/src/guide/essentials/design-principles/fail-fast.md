# Fail Fast

Fail fast is the idea that a system should detect and report errors as soon as they occur, rather than allowing them to propagate and potentially lead to more difficult-to-diagnose problems.

**Purpose:** By catching errors early, you can prevent further problems, improve debugging, and enhance system reliability.

**Application:**
- Use assertions, exceptions, and validation to check input data and system states early.
- Avoid allowing unexpected states or conditions to linger undetected.
