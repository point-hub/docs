# Separation of Concerns (SoC)

This principle states that different concerns or responsibilities of a program should be separated into distinct sections.

**Purpose:** Separation of concerns helps make the code more modular, easier to maintain, and allows changes to one part of the system without affecting others.

**Application:**
- In a web application, separate the presentation layer (UI), business logic, and data storage layers.
- Use different classes, methods, or modules for distinct tasks (e.g., one class for handling user input and another for processing data).
