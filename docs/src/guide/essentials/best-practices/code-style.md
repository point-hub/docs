# Code Style

Code style refers to the conventions, standards, and best practices followed when writing code in a particular programming language or project. It ensures that code is readable, maintainable, and consistent, making it easier for teams to collaborate, debug, and enhance software over time. A well-defined code style can help reduce errors, improve performance, and make onboarding new team members easier.

Code Formatting Tools
Why it matters: Automated tools can help maintain consistent code formatting and style across the entire codebase.
How to achieve it: Use linters (e.g., ESLint, Pylint, RuboCop) and formatters (e.g., Prettier, Black, autopep8) to enforce coding standards and automate formatting tasks.
