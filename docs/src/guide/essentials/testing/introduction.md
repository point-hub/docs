# Testing

Testing methodologies are structured approaches used in software development to evaluate the functionality, reliability, performance, and other characteristics of a system or application. 

These methodologies guide the testing process to ensure that the software meets the required quality standards. Here are some of the most common testing methodologies:

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

In TDD, tests are written before the code is developed. The cycle typically involves writing a failing test, writing the code to pass the test, and then refactoring the code as necessary.

Ensures high code quality and fewer defects, promotes modularity.

## Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

BDD is an extension of TDD that emphasizes collaboration between developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders. It focuses on the behavior of the system and uses plain language specifications.

Involves stakeholders more deeply, improves communication, and makes requirements clearer.

## Continuous Testing

Continuous testing is a methodology in which tests are automated and run continuously throughout the software development lifecycle. This is closely aligned with continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipelines.

Ensures immediate feedback and can detect issues early.

## Performance Testing

This methodology focuses on testing the performance, scalability, and responsiveness of the software. It includes load testing, stress testing, and scalability testing to ensure the system can handle expected or extreme user loads.

Identifies bottlenecks, helps improve system performance.

## End-to-End Testing (E2E)

Involves testing the entire system flow from start to finish, ensuring that different parts of the system interact as expected.

To validate workflows across multiple components and layers of the application.
