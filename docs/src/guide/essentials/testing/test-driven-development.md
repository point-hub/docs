## Definition:
Test-Driven Development is a software development process where developers write tests before writing the actual code that implements the functionality. The cycle involves writing a test, making the test pass by writing the minimal code required, and then refactoring the code to improve quality.

## Key Steps (Red-Green-Refactor):
Red: Write a test that fails because the feature or functionality isn't implemented yet.
Green: Write just enough code to make the test pass.
Refactor: Clean up the code (e.g., optimize, remove duplication) without changing its behavior.

## Focus:
Unit testing.
Ensures that each unit of the application works as expected.
The emphasis is on code correctness and design.
